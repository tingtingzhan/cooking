\description{
\linkS4class{sundae} recipe with my secret dairy base.
}
\details{
Heavy cream has very high water content.
Also, egg yolk (and water bath pasterization / emulsification) is necessary.
I do not use heavy cream at all

Mascarpone cheese (with water) gives very good texture
if slightly thaw (in fridge) before serving.
No egg yolk required!!
However, it is a little too oily for me.

Non-fat Greek yogurt have a very strong flavor,
thus I don't like it as a sole base for ice-cream.
Greek yogurt is a little more fluid than mascarpone cheese, but not much!

Do not use too much water!! I get frost bite!!
