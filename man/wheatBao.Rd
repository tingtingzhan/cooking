\details{
Must use much more fat, otherwise wrapper tears off on filing.

\note{
Using \eqn{100\%} (white) wheat flour does not provide enough strength of gluten,
leading to a very soft dough and very weak Man Tou.
However, (white) wheat dough with overnight resting in fridge prior to kneading,
is very smooth in the surface and in mouth.

Wegmans (white) wheat flour has the same water absorption capability as Wegmans bread flour.

For better coloring, prefer white wheat flour over wheat flour.
